# citelocal-agent — chat with your papers, fully local

[中文](README.md) | **English**

Ask questions across a pile of papers (or any local docs) and get answers with
**page-precise, verified citations** — running **entirely on your machine**. Built
on [LangGraph](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/).

Cloud paper tools (ChatPDF, Elicit, …) make you **upload your PDFs**. citelocal-agent
doesn't: embeddings run locally, papers never leave your disk (`papers/` is
gitignored), and you can even run the answer model locally via Ollama. What you
get back is grounded — every citation is checked against what was actually
retrieved, down to the **PDF page**.

## Why it's different

- 🔒 **Fully local / private** — your PDFs are never uploaded; local embeddings,
  optional local LLM (Ollama). Good for unpublished or sensitive papers.
- 📎 **Page-precise, verified citations** — answers cite `paper.pdf (p.3)`; cited
  locators are **checked against retrieval**, hallucinated ones are dropped.
- 🔗 **Cross-paper synthesis** — the agent searches, re-queries, and combines
  facts from multiple papers in one answer.
- 🙅 **Honest refusal** — if the papers don't cover it, it says so (relevance
  threshold), instead of making something up.
- 🧪 **Real retrieval** — hybrid dense (bge) + BM25 → RRF → cross-encoder rerank.
- 💬 **CLI + Web UI**, 🔭 **retrieval trace**, 📊 **eval harness**, multi-format
  (PDF / Markdown / RST / text).

## Quickstart

```bash
# 1. Environment (Python 3.11)
conda create -n citelocal-agent python=3.11 -c conda-forge
conda activate citelocal-agent
pip install -e .

# 2. Answer LLM: put OPENAI_API_KEY in .env — or go fully local:
cp .env.example .env
#   pip install -e ".[ollama]"  &&  set LLM_MODEL=ollama:llama3.1 in .env

# 3. Get some papers (downloaded locally, never uploaded) and index them
python scripts/fetch_arxiv.py --demo          # 8 papers: Attention, RAG, BERT, T5, RoBERTa, DPR, SBERT, GPT-3
#   or: python scripts/fetch_arxiv.py 1706.03762 2005.11401  (any arXiv ids)
python -m citelocal_agent.ingest --path ./papers --reset

# 4. Ask
python -m citelocal_agent.ask --trace "How is BERT related to the Transformer?"
#   multi-turn chat (follow-ups remember earlier turns):
python -m citelocal_agent.chat
#   or the web UI:
python -m citelocal_agent.web        # http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

Point `ingest --path` at any folder of your own `.pdf` / `.md` / `.rst` / `.txt`.

## Example run

A **cross-paper** question — the agent searches, lists sources, re-queries, then
answers from two papers with page citations (real output):

```console
$ python -m citelocal_agent.ask --trace "How does retrieval-augmented generation use a retriever, and how is BERT related to the Transformer architecture?"
🔎 Intent: IN_SCOPE — retrieving from knowledge base
=== trace ===
  1. search_docs  query='retrieval-augmented generation retriever BERT Transformer architecture'
  2. list_sources
  3. search_docs  query='BERT Transformer architecture bidirectional encoder layers'

=== Answer ===
RAG uses a retriever to access a dense vector index … the retriever provides
latent documents conditioned on the input, and the model marginalizes over
seq2seq predictions given different retrieved documents
[retrieval-augmented-generation.pdf (p.1); retrieval-augmented-generation.pdf (p.2)].
BERT is a multi-layer bidirectional Transformer encoder, based on the original
Transformer [bert.pdf (p.1); bert.pdf (p.3)].

=== Citations ===
- retrieval-augmented-generation.pdf (p.1)
- bert.pdf (p.1)
- bert.pdf (p.3)
```

Out-of-scope questions are declined; offline, `python scripts/check_retrieval.py`
shows the raw retrieval stack with no API key.

## Web UI

![citelocal-agent web UI](docs/ui-answer.png)

A small chat front-end (FastAPI + a static Tailwind page) showing the answer, the
intent badge, citation chips, dropped (unsupported) citations, and a collapsible
retrieval trace. `python -m citelocal_agent.web` → http://127.0.0.1:8000.

API:
- `POST /api/ask {question, session_id?, collection?}` → `{kind, intent, answer, question, citations, unsupported, trace}`
- `POST /api/ask/stream` — same body, Server-Sent Events: a `step` event per graph node, then a `final` event
- `GET /api/sources {collection?}` → `{sources}`; `GET /health` → `{status}`

Pass a stable `session_id` to hold a multi-turn conversation (per-thread
checkpointer), and `collection` to serve several knowledge bases from one server.
Set `DOCAGENT_API_KEY` to require `X-API-Key` on `/api/*`, and
`RATE_LIMIT_REQUESTS` / `RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW` for a per-client rate limit.

### Docker

```bash
docker build -t citelocal-agent .
# ingest into a mounted volume, then serve it:
docker run --rm -v $PWD/papers:/papers -v $PWD/chroma_db:/data/chroma citelocal-agent \
  python -m citelocal_agent.ingest --path /papers --reset
docker run -p 8000:8000 -v $PWD/chroma_db:/data/chroma -e OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-... citelocal-agent
```

      RERANK --> THRESH[relevance threshold]
      THRESH --> OUT2[top-k chunks + page/line locators]
    end
```

The agent is built by `build_agent(config)` — no model/reranker is initialised at
import time; tools are bound to the configured retriever (`make_retrieval_tools`).

## Evaluation

The eval set is a curated, **category-labelled** QA dataset in
`src/citelocal_agent/eval/data/qa_cases.jsonl` (one JSON row per case). Each row carries
an `intent`, a `category` (`single_paper` / `multi_hop` / `numeric` /
`definitional` / `out_of_scope` / `no_answer`), gold `expected_sources`, an
LLM-judged `criteria`, and a `split`:

- `offline_sample` — answerable from the bundled `sample_notes/`; runs with no
  paper download (used by the offline LLM test suite).
- `full_corpus` — needs the downloaded `papers/`; the manual / nightly eval.

**Grow the set (generate → curate → eval):**

```bash
python scripts/fetch_arxiv.py --demo && python -m citelocal_agent.ingest --path ./papers --reset
python scripts/generate_qa.py --n-per-category 25   # LLM-drafts candidates from real chunks
#   -> review src/citelocal_agent/eval/data/generated_raw.jsonl, set curated=true,
#      and merge good rows into qa_cases.jsonl
python -m citelocal_agent.eval.run_eval                    # full_corpus, per-category table
python -m citelocal_agent.eval.run_eval --split offline_sample --categories multi_hop
```

`run_eval` reports every metric **overall and broken down by category** (the
per-category view is what lets a change prove it actually helps, e.g. multi-hop),
and writes a machine-readable `eval_results.json` baseline for tracking deltas.

The bundled corpus is now **106 notes** (`sample_notes/`) spanning architecture
internals, training, tokenization, alignment, decoding, retrieval, vector indexes,
RAG, agents, and evaluation — a larger, harder-to-discriminate retrieval corpus.
The curated eval set holds **190 cases** across 6 categories (`offline_sample` +
the 8-paper `full_corpus`). **56 multi-hop cases deliberately require retrieving
several documents at once** (each labels ≥2 `expected_sources`), stress-testing
the "one question, many articles" path. The table below is a **full measured run**:
all **159 `offline_sample` cases** over the repo's bundled **106 `sample_notes/`**,
with **`gpt-5.4-mini`** (via an OpenAI-compatible gateway) as both the answer and
judge model. Numbers move with the model/corpus — swap `LLM_MODEL` and re-run
`run_eval --split offline_sample` to reproduce. (The 31 `full_corpus` cases need the
8 demo papers downloaded first and are not included here.)

| Metric | Result |
|---|---|
| Intent routing accuracy | **99%** (158/159) |
| Retrieval recall (single-shot) | **0.89** |
| Source coverage (agent, end-to-end) | **0.95** |
| Answer correctness (LLM-judged) | **97%** (141/145) |
| Citation grounding | **93%** (135/145) |
| Refusal accuracy | **93%** (13/14) |
| Hallucinated citations | **2** (this run; varies 0–4 across runs, always on questions it should refuse) |

> **Two retrieval metrics (important):** `recall` is a single search on the whole
> compound question — is each gold source in the top-k? `coverage` is what the agent
> *actually* retrieved this run, unioned over the orchestrator's per-sub-question
> retrievals for multi-hop. The latter reflects real capability — see multi-hop below.

Per category:

| Category | n | intent | recall | cover | answer | grounding | refusal |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| single_paper | 41 | 1.00 | 0.95 | 1.00 | 1.00 | 0.90 | — |
| definitional | 43 | 1.00 | 0.93 | 1.00 | 1.00 | 0.91 | — |
| multi_hop | 54 | 1.00 | 0.80 | 0.87 | 0.93 | 0.98 | — |
| numeric | 7 | 1.00 | 1.00 | 1.00 | 1.00 | 0.86 | — |
| out_of_scope | 5 | 0.80 | — | — | — | — | 1.00 |
| no_answer | 9 | 1.00 | — | — | — | — | 0.89 |

> **Multi-document ("one question, many articles")** is the focus and the hardest
> case: across the **54 multi-hop questions** (each needs ≥2 documents) — citation
> grounding **0.98**, **0 hallucinated citations in this category**, answer
> correctness **0.93**. Split the retrieval metrics: single-shot recall is **0.80**,
> agent **end-to-end source coverage 0.87** (strict all-of — it must surface *every*
> passage a question needs, not the looser any-of recall@k). Both are up from earlier
> (0.70 / 0.83): retrieval now uses a **two-threshold gate** — `SCORE_THRESHOLD` still
> gates abstention, and once it opens, a looser `SUPPORT_THRESHOLD` admits the mildly
> -negative second source the reranker would otherwise drop. This lifts multi-hop
> recall 0.70 → 0.80 **with refusal behaviour unchanged** (diagnosis + method in the
> [failure-case backlog](docs/failure-cases.md)). The residual gap is sources the
> reranker scores deeply negative — that needs a stronger reranker.

> **Known weak spots (failure cases, recorded honestly):** (1) hallucinated citations
> all land on questions the system *should* refuse (no_answer / out_of_scope; 0–4
> across runs) — it occasionally invents a locator for something the docs don't cover,
> the next gap for citation verification to close; (2) 1 of 5 out_of_scope questions
> is mis-routed as in_scope (intent 0.80, small n); (3) refusal accuracy is 0.89–0.93,
> not perfect; (4) multi-hop end-to-end coverage 0.87 isn't maxed — the residual gap is
> sources the reranker scores deeply negative (the two-threshold gate already avoided
> the "lower the threshold → hurt abstention" trade-off). These, with the 27 single-shot
> recall misses and their root-cause diagnosis, are catalogued in the
> [failure-case backlog](docs/failure-cases.md). Numbers depend on `LLM_MODEL`.

CI runs ruff, mypy, offline unit tests (no network/model), retrieval tests over
`sample_notes`, and a wheel-packages-the-UI smoke test.

Problems hit during development / wiring real models / evaluation, and how they
were solved: see [engineering notes](docs/engineering-notes.md).
